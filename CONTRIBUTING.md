## 🚀 Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Repository Setup

   First, fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button:

   [![Fork Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork%20Repository-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/MLShukai/pamiq-vrchat/fork)

   After fork, clone your repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-name/pamiq-vrchat.git
   cd pamiq-vrchat
   ```

2. Building the Docker Environment

   ```sh
   # Build the image
   make docker-build

   # Start the container (see options below)
   make docker-up

   # Connect to the container
   make docker-attach
   ```

   **Docker Environment Options:**

   The Docker setup supports different configurations based on your machine:

   ```sh
   # Start with all features (GPU and audio)
   make docker-up

   # Start without GPU support (for machines without NVIDIA GPUs)
   make docker-up ENABLE_GPU=false

   # Start without audio support
   make docker-up ENABLE_AUDIO=false

   # Start with minimal features (no GPU, no audio)
   make docker-up ENABLE_GPU=false ENABLE_AUDIO=false
   ```

3. Git Initial Configuration

   ```sh
   git config user.name <your GitHub username>
   git config user.email <your GitHub email>
   ```

## 💻 Development Environment Configuration

### Development with VSCode

You can develop by attaching to the container from your preferred editor (VSCode recommended).

📚 Reference: [Attach with VSCode Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/attach-container)

The development container includes the following environment:

- Package manager ([**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- Git for version control
- Required dependencies (OpenCV, InputtIno, PulseAudio, etc.)
- Development dependency packages

## 🔄 Development Workflow

Use the following commands for development:

```sh
# Set up Python virtual environment
make venv

# Format code and run pre-commit hooks
make format

# Run tests
make test

# Run type checking
make type

# Run the entire workflow (format, test, type)
make run
```

## ⚙️ Environment Management

### Stopping the Container

```sh
make docker-down
```

### Cleaning Up the Development Environment

```sh
make clean
```

### ⚠️ Complete Deletion (Use Caution)

```sh
# Warning: All work data will be deleted!
make docker-down-volume
```

## 🤝 Contribution Flow

1. Create a new branch for feature additions or bug fixes
2. Make your changes
3. Write tests for new features
4. Run the entire workflow before sending a PR:
   ```shell
   make run
   ```
5. Submit a Pull Request with a clear explanation of your changes

If you have questions or issues, please create an Issue in the GitHub repository.
